Whenever most people think of the word "hacking," they often picture a masked and hooded figure in a dark room with green text scrolling across a dark screen. Well, that image comes from films and TV shows that are depicting it wrong and compress weeks of technical knowledge into a few seconds of visuals. However, how true is this? Is it entertainment or reality? 

#### Brief History
The word "hack" has been floating around for a while, with it being used as early as the 1950s at the MIT Tech Model Railroad club when it originally referred to devising a clever solution. However, over time it developed into nouns like "hacker" to describe a systems enthusiast. By the early 2000s as large scale cyberattacks began on the rise, public perception changed with hacking being associated with intrusion and crime.   

#### What Cybersecurity Actually Looks like
For the typical internet user, cybersecurity usually means practical habits which involves creating strong, unique passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication on your social media accounts, avoiding suspicious links, and limiting the amount of personal information being shared online. This is definitely true, as these many successful cybersecurity attacks rely on weak account credentials, reused passwords, or phishing emails. But if we try to apply this perception of cybersecurity to an organizational level or industry wide, the scope of knowledge expands...significantly. 

When you scale it up to the organizational level, cybersecurity becomes more than just clicking on passwords and making sure you have a complex password. It is a combination of people, processes, and technology specifically designed to reduce cybersecurity risk: the potential for loss or disruption to an organization due to a cybersecurity threat. Instead of being a single team or set of tools, it is a function embedded in the company that continues to better itself over time. 

To put it in a very broad way, ethical cybersecurity is split into two teams: blue and red.

Blue teamers are the professionals who focus on defending an organization from cybersecurity threats. They use different tools to monitor systems, look at logs, configure security settings, and respond to security incidents. This kind of work usually happens in what is known as a Security Operations Center or SOC for short and in many cases, they are often ran 24/7 since cybersecurity threats can occur from anywhere in the world. Inside a SOC, these professional analysts will typically have access to a majority of the information that moves across the organization so any websites you are visiting, any files you're transferring or downloading, are all tracked. All of this information is fed into this software called a Security Incident and Event Management tool, also known as SIEM and all it allows the blue team to centralize all this information, analyze it, and respond to potentially malicious behavior. 

On the other hand, the red team refers to cybersecurity professionals that try to perform cybersecurity attacks on an organization to simulate how an actual cybersecurity threat would try to hack the infrastructure. They are often given permission by the company to try and bypass defenses, attempt phishing campaigns, or even perform physical breaches of the company premises. However, instead of trying to purposefully harm the company, they are hired to provide insight to the company on what cybersecurity vulnerabilities they may have and should work on, which ultimately helps these organizations what to improve on so they are less likely to be a victim of a cybersecurity attack in the future. While they share different goals and processes than the blue team, both the red team and blue team work together to increase the security posture (known as cybersecurity strength) of the organization. 

Of course, cybersecurity isn't just limited to a dedicated blue and red team. The entire organization is part of the overall cybersecurity effort. For example, security teams often work together with the IT team to help respond to cybersecurity incidents, they may ask them to reset a user's password, make a security configuration change on the company's network, or purge all of the emails belonging to a phishing campaign. Another case would be the legal team which would be heavily involved if a cybersecurity threat was successfully able to break into the company network and steal data. Lastly, the typical user or even executive board is responsible for maintaining strong cybersecurity awareness, tying back to the concept of strong passwords and recognizing phishing attempts. 

#### The role of risk and human Error
Another misconception is that cybersecurity breaches happen because a hacker typed a bunch of words and sophisticated code really fast on a terminal to break into a network. However in reality, many cybersecurity incidents happen because of something simple. For example, exposed cloud storage, overly permissive access controls, unpatched software, employees falling for phishing attempts. You would be surprised at how many cybersecurity incidents happen because of simple things like this. 

For example, in October 2016, attackers were successfully able to breach Uber's Amazon S3 datastore and this allowed them to steal tons of users' personal information, of which were about 600,000 U.S driver license numbers. The catch? They were able to access this information because there were hardcoded AWS keys (like passwords, but for a service) hardcoded in a private github repository.

#### Summary
At the end of the day, it is rather apparent that the popular image of hacking, that being fast typing and instant access, is largely fictional. In the real world, cybersecurity (when done right), is strucutured, process-driven, and risk-focused. Although at the individual level it still encompasses simple means like good password practices and phishing, cybersecurity is more than just that when it comes to scaling up to the size of an organization and is rather a collaborative effort driven by different individuals and teams.
