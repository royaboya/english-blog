When it comes to the internet nowadays and tracking, most people assume it only happens when they install something suspicious like malware or when a large cybersecurity breach takes place. However, we live in a world where it is not all sunshine and rainbows. In reality, tracking is often pervasive and happens in every website we visit and during every interaction we have with the web. Tracking is not limited to hackers, but extends to advertisers, data brokers, analytics companies, and the government agencies. 

#### How much data do you leave behind online?
Every action you take on the internet leaves a trace. Now consider all of the times you've interacted with the web and take a look below and see which ones you have done:

1) Registered an account on a website
2) Submitted a form
3) Purchased something online 
4) Allowed a website to access your location
5) Cicked accept all on Cookies
6) Searched something up
7) Connected to a game
8) Made a post on social media

Now think to yourself, what kind of information can they gain from this? Let's take a deep dive in and take a look at some of them.
- Registering an account or submitting a form can reveal your name, email address, username, password (hashed), phone number, and date of birth.
- Purchasing an item may provide your physical address, name, shopping behavior. 
- Connecting to a website or a game can expose your IP address, device type, operating system, browser, session ID, cookies, advertising identifiers, hardware information, and precise or general location.

Ask yourself again: How comfortable am I with having big data collect all this information about me? Why should I care?

### Why you should care about leaving your data behind online
The information you leave online can have consequences far beyond typical minor inconveniences.
Key reasons include privacy loss, targeted manipulation, identity theft or fraud, physical security risks, and digital permanence, each of which can demonstrate how online activity can affect your life in lasting ways.

#### Privacy Loss
Every bit of personal information that you let people collect online such as emails, location, shopping habits, search queries, cookies, are all collected and aggregated to build a profile about you. The reason why this is a concern is because companies advertisers, and potentially malicious actors can infer your behavior like routines, preferences, relationships, or health information and then make decisions based off of that.

#### Targeted Manipulation
Advertisers and political campaigns can use the data about you to curate specific advertisements or campaigns in an attempt to sway your emotions, opinions, and behavior without you being aware of it. 

#### Identity Theft & Fraud
If you share too much information online, it increases the chance that you or other companies might be susceptible to social engineering attempts because if an attacker gets enough personal information about you, theoretically they can prove they are you! Think about the security questions you had to answer when creating an account somewhere on the internet: What street did you grow up on? What was the name of your first pet? Where did you go for college? All of this information can be used to impersonate you.

#### Physical Security Risks
This one can be explained with a simple example. If you post on facebook that you and your family will be going on vacation, burglars might know when they should burglarize your home. Does this sit comfortably with you?

#### Digital Permanence
You often heard people say once it's on the internet, it is there forever. This is quite true, archives like the waybackmachine exist and they create a snapshot of the internet's sites at various times of the year. In addition, social media companies may retain backups of deleted posts despite assurances that your data was deleted.

#### Data Tracking
Now considering the abundance of user data left online, let's move onto the important part: tracking. 

Tracking often happens in a way that most internet users don't notice and it often happens in the background silently. Websites use cookies which are essentially just small files that contain some unique identifier about you. These cookies are stored in your web browser to remember your activity and preferences. Many of these cookies are used to track what pages you visit, how long you stayed on a website, and what links on the site you have clicked. In addition, companies also use the information about your web browser (think Chrome & Safari) to track you. This is called browser fingerprinting in which they collect information like your device type, screen resolution, fonts, and operating system type all to create a unique profile about you. Now if you combine this information with the information you left online, companies now have a complete profile of you and your habits.

You may be thinking: okay, companies have this information already, what if I do want to be tracked and get recommended better products curated for me? Well, the issue is, this information can also be collected and aggregrated to data brokers (who collect information from dozens of other sources as well) who then will sell that same data to other companies without your consent. In other words, even if you limit your activity to a select set of websites, your information can still end up in the hands of a completely unrelated data entity. 

#### Practical steps & what you can do
Okay so big data has everything on me, what should I do?

While complete anonymity is impossible in the real world, there are steps and strategies you can take to reduce how much data and tracking you have online. 

To take control over your online privacy, there are some steps you can take in the right direction. You can start by using browsers that are built with privacy in mind, two of which are [Brave](brave.com) and [Firefox](firefox.com/en-US/) as they block trackers by default. You can also install reputable third party extensions like uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger to limit any third party tracking. Also regularly clearing the cookies in your browser and clearing your browser cache is good to do as it reduces persistent identifiers about you and using a VPN can mask your IP address to make it harder for companies to trace your online activity. When possible, always try to limit the amount of cookies you are saying yes to receiving whenever you are visiting a website. Also be mindful of what information you post on social media, like people say to think before you speak, think before you post!
